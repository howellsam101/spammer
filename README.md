# spammer
This is a fun project made using python, that can be used to spam on desktop sites. 

Please note that this is for educational purposes and I DO NOT recommend that you use 
this to spam someone. Doing so on certain sites could get you into trouble or blocked. 

This script requires the pynput python module to be installed. You can read more about the 
pynput module from the pypi.org site. 

The script will automate keystrokes on the keyboard. In the current state, once the script
is active, the user will press '2' on the key board and the script will start typing out text,
send it by pressing 'enter' and repeat untill stopped by either pressing '2' again, '1' (to exit)
or cmd c in the terminal. 

There is alot of room for imrovment in this script. changing the start and stop keys would 
be a good idea. Or implementing mouse clicks with pynput.mouse or by using the pyautogui module.
